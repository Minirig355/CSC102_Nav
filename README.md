"# CSC102 - CSS

This isn't the exact CSS parameters asked for in the assignment, but I hope I've demonstrated my familiarity with CSS styling. I am just really fond of my current CSS layout and noticed it covers all of the specific CSS functions requested, just not necessarily in the same place or value as asked. I even tried to demonstrate more CSS skills in hopes that it'll make up for the mismatched values.

I also have navbar.css that handles the functions with the navbar including highlighting your current page and highlighting on hover. I would like to eventually work on the aesthetics of this a little more like maybe a inverted border radius where it meets the main page, rather than the 90 degree angle.
